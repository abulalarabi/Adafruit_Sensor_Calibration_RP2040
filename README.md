# Adafruit Unified Sensor Calibration Library RP2040/ESP
This modified version of the original library depends on LittleFS file system for reading/writing calibration values instead of traditional SDfat library. It works with RP2040 and ESP boards.

# ToDo:
* Remove unnecessary codes.
* Check for correct file name.
